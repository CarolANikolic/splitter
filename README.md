Splitter is a tip calculator that allows you to choose from default tip percetages or to customize the tip. This application will automatically calculate the total value of the tip per person as well as the total value of tip plus the bill.
The purpose of this project is to test my abilities in HTML, CSS and JS.

## Technologies used :hammer_and_wrench:
- [HTML5](https://html.com)
- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)

## Requirements :computer:

To work with the code, you will need, before you begin, to install in your machine Git. Also, it's a good idea to have a source-code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Main Learnings :nerd_face:-
> Use of forEach method to iterate through buttons<br>  
> Work with svg images
